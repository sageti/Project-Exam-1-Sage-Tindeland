            <h1>SpaceX Technology</h1>
            <p>SpaceX has been delivering <a href="#word-list" class="bold">cargo</a> to and from the International Space Station since 2012, and in 2020 SpaceX began transporting people to the orbiting laboratory under NASA&apos;s Commercial Crew Program.</p>

                <h2>Reusability</h2>
                <p>SpaceX believes a fully and rapidly reusable rocket is the breakthrough needed to substantially reduce the cost of space access. The majority of the launch cost comes from building the rocket, which historically has flown only once.</p>
                <p>Compare that to a commercial airliner â€“ each new plane costs about the same as falcon 9 but can fly multiple times per day and conduct tens of thousands of flights over its lifetime. Following the commercial model, a rapidly reusable space launch vehicle could reduce the cost of traveling to space by a hundredfold.</p>
                <p>While most rockets are designed to burn up on <a href="#word-list" class="bold">reentry</a>, spaceX rockets can not only withstand reentry but can also successfully land back on earth and refly again.</p>

                <h3>Falcon 9</h3>
                <p>First orbital class rocket capable of reflight</p>
                <p>Falcon 9 is a reusable, two-stage rocket designed and manufactured by spacex for the reliable and safe transport of people and payloads into earth <a href="#word-list" class="bold">orbit</a> and beyond. Falcon 9 is the world&apos;s first orbital class reusable rocket. Reusability allows spacex to refly the most expensive parts of the rocket, which in turn drives down the cost of space access.</p>

                <p>The world&apos;s most powerful rocket</p>
                <p>Falcon heavy is the most powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of two. With the ability to lift into orbit nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lb) falcon heavy can lift more than twice the payload of the next closest operational vehicle, the delta iv heavy. Falcon heavy is composed of three falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft.</p>

                <p>The dragon spacecraft is capable of carrying up to 7 passengers to and from earth orbit, and beyond. It is the only spacecraft currently flying that is capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to earth, and is the first private spacecraft to take humans to the space station.</p>
