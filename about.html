            <blockquote>
                <p>SpaceX is a private company under the direction of one person, Elon Musk. The company builds and launches rockets, flies a space capsule that can carry crew and cargo to the International Space Station, and is deploying a massive constellation of small satellites called Starlink intended to provide global high-speed internet access. </p>
                <p>SpaceX has helped renew the public&apos;s interest in spaceflight. The company makes excellent use of livestreaming technology, making each rocket launch and landing an exciting event. The interest in SpaceX&apos;s efforts, which are often in partnership with NASA have inspired new generations to pursue exciting space careers. <cite>Read more about the <a href="https://www.planetary.org/articles/nasa-versus-spacex"> dependencies and differences between SpaceX and NASA.</a></cite></p>

            <blockquote>
                <h3>Making humanity multiplanetary</h3>
                <p>Building on the achievements of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, SpaceX is working on a next generation of fully reusable launch vehicles that will be the most powerful ever built, capable of carrying humans to Mars and other destinations in the solar system.</p>
                <h3>Making history</h3>
                <p>SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones. It is the only private company capable of returning a spacecraft from low-Earth orbit, and in 2012 the Dragon spacecraft became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to and from the International Space Station. In 2020, SpaceX became the first private company to take humans there as well.</p>
                <p>SpaceX has the first and only orbital class rockets capable of reflight. <cite>Read more about <a href="https://www.spacex.com/mission/">SpaceX&apos;s mission and achievements</a></cite>.</p>
